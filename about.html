    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="section">
        <p>
            I am a Senior Software Engineer with over four years of experience working
            on software systems where reliability, correctness, and long-term
            maintainability are essential. My professional background spans
            research-driven engineering and industry-grade development across
            automotive, medical, and large-scale infrastructure domains.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the course of my career, I have worked on projects ranging from
            simulation and analytical tools developed in academic and research
            environments to production software deployed in real-world, safety-critical
            systems. This combination has shaped the way I think about software —
            not just as code, but as part of a larger system with real operational impact.
        </p>

    <!-- ENGINEERING APPROACH -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>How I approach engineering</h2>

        <p>
            I prefer clear, well-reasoned solutions over unnecessary complexity.
            My focus is on building software that is understandable, testable,
            and resilient over time. I pay close attention to edge cases,
            failure modes, and integration boundaries, especially in systems
            where incorrect behavior can have serious consequences.
        </p>

        <p>
            Working in safety-critical and regulated environments has reinforced
            the importance of disciplined development practices. I value
            structured debugging, careful analysis, and documentation when
            it meaningfully contributes to software quality and team effectiveness.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- TECHNICAL IDENTITY -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Technical focus</h2>

        <p>
            My core technical strengths lie in C++ and Qt-based application development,
            particularly for system-intensive software. I am comfortable working
            across multiple layers of the stack — from application logic and user
            interfaces to investigating system-level behavior in Linux-based
            environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have experience working with long-lived codebases, integrating new
            functionality into existing systems, and supporting software through
            debugging, validation, and iterative improvement cycles.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CURRENT DIRECTION -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Current focus and direction</h2>

        <p>
            In addition to my professional responsibilities, I actively work on
            personal projects and open-source contributions to deepen my understanding
            of system-level programming, tooling, and software design principles.
            This allows me to continuously refine my skills beyond immediate
            project requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am particularly interested in roles that involve complex systems,
            long-term ownership of software, and collaboration within experienced
            engineering teams where thoughtful design and reliability are valued
            over rapid but fragile solutions.
