        <p>
            I am a software engineer with over four years of experience working on
            systems where reliability, correctness, and long-term maintainability
            matter. My background spans automotive and medical domains, where
            software is expected to behave predictably under real-world constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
            I primarily work with C++ and Qt, and I am comfortable operating across
            different layers of the stack — from application logic and user interfaces
            to debugging system-level issues on Linux-based environments.
        </p>

        <h2>How I approach engineering</h2>

        <p>
            I value clarity over complexity and prefer solutions that are easy to
            reason about, test, and maintain. I pay close attention to edge cases,
            failure modes, and long-term impact rather than short-term fixes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Working in safety-critical and regulated environments has shaped my
            approach to development: careful analysis, structured debugging, and
            respect for process where it adds real value.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Current focus</h2>

        <p>
            Alongside professional work, I actively use personal projects and
            open-source contributions to deepen my understanding of system-level
            programming, tooling, and software design principles.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am particularly interested in roles that involve complex systems,
            long-lived codebases, and collaboration with experienced engineering teams.
