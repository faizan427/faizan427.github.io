        <h2>High-Speed Rail Traction Power Analysis Software</h2>

        <p>
            Designed and developed a custom software application for analyzing
            traction power supply systems for high-speed rail corridors.
            The project was carried out as a sponsored research and development
            initiative at the Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre (IRCC),
            IIT Bombay.
        </p>

        <p>
            The software was developed as an integrated solution combining a
            Qt-based C++ application with Octave-based computational models,
            enabling advanced electrical analysis of railway traction systems.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Designed and implemented the front-end and back-end using C++ and Qt.</li>
            <li>Performed R&amp;D for electrical logic specific to traction power systems.</li>
            <li>Integrated Octave-based numerical models with the Qt C++ application.</li>
