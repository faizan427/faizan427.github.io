        <h2>High-Speed Rail Traction Power Analysis Software</h2>

        <p>
            Designed and developed a custom software application for analyzing
            traction power supply systems for high-speed rail corridors.
            The project was carried out as a sponsored research and development
            initiative at the Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre (IRCC),
            IIT Bombay.
        </p>

        <p>
            The software was developed as an integrated solution combining a
            Qt-based C++ application with Octave-based computational models,
            enabling advanced electrical analysis of railway traction systems.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Designed and implemented the front-end and back-end of the
                application using C++ with the Qt framework.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conducted research and development (R&amp;D) activities for
                electrical logic design specific to high-speed rail traction
                power systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Integrated Octave-based numerical models with the Qt C++
                application to create a unified analysis workflow.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented electrical analysis capabilities including
                load flow analysis, short-circuit analysis, and harmonics analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed the software to accept railway timetable data and
                route-level parameters as inputs for scenario-based analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Worked in a Linux-based development environment following
                structured research, validation, and documentation practices.
            </li>
        </ul>
