        <h2>High-Speed Rail Traction Power Analysis Software</h2>

        <p>
            Designed and developed a custom software system for analyzing
            traction power supply behavior in high-speed rail corridors.
            This work was carried out as part of a sponsored research and
            development initiative at the Industrial Research and Consultancy
            Centre (IRCC), IIT Bombay.
        </p>

        <p>
            The solution was implemented as an integrated platform combining
            a Qt-based C++ application with Octave-driven numerical computation,
            enabling comprehensive electrical analysis of railway traction systems.
        </p>

            <li>
                Architected and implemented both front-end and back-end components
                using C++ and the Qt framework.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conducted research and development for electrical logic tailored
                to high-speed rail traction power requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Integrated Octave-based computational models into the C++ application
                to support complex numerical analysis workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented core electrical studies including load flow analysis,
                short-circuit analysis, and harmonics analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed the system to consume railway timetables and route-level
                parameters as inputs for scenario-based evaluation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Developed and validated the software in a Linux-based environment
                following structured testing and documentation practices.
