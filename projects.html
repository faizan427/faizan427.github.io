        <h2>High-Speed Rail Traction Power Analysis Software</h2>

        <p>
            Designed and developed a custom software application for analyzing
            traction power supply systems for high-speed rail corridors.
            The project was carried out as a sponsored research and development
            initiative at the Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre (IRCC),
            IIT Bombay.
        </p>

        <p>
            The software was developed as an integrated solution combining a
            Qt-based C++ application with Octave-based computational models,
            enabling advanced electrical analysis of railway traction systems.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Designed and implemented the front-end and back-end of the
                application using C++ with the Qt framework.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conducted research and development (R&amp;D) activities for
                electrical logic design specific to high-speed rail traction
                power systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Integrated Octave-based numerical models with the Qt C++
                application to create a unified analysis workflow.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented electrical analysis capabilities including
                load flow analysis, short-circuit analysis, and harmonics analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed the software to accept railway timetable data and
                route-level parameters as inputs for scenario-based analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Worked in a Linux-based development environment following
                structured research, validation, and documentation practices.

        <h2>Metro Crew Scheduling & Timetabling Optimization System</h2>

        <p>
            This project focused on the development of an optimized crew scheduling
            and timetabling solution for manned metro operations at Delhi Metro
            Rail Corporation (DMRC). The objective was to generate efficient
            operational schedules by applying mathematical modeling techniques
            to real-world metro constraints.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Led a technical team of 3–4 members, coordinating development
                tasks and guiding implementation efforts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed and implemented mathematical models for metro crew
                scheduling and timetable generation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Developed the complete solution using Python in a Linux-based
                environment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Worked with operational inputs such as timetable data and
                route parameters to generate optimized crew schedules.
            </li>
            <li>
                Focused on correctness, optimization, and practical applicability
                of generated schedules for manned metro systems.
