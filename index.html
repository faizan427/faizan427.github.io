            I design and develop production-grade software for complex engineering systems.
            My work spans automotive platforms, medical devices, and power systems, with a
            strong focus on C++, Qt-based applications, and safety-critical development.
            I have hands-on experience taking software from research and prototyping
            through validation and real-world deployment.
